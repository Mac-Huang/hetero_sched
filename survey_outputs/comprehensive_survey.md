## Abstract

The intersection of reinforcement learning (RL) and heterogeneous system scheduling 
            represents a rapidly evolving research area with significant practical implications 
            for modern computing infrastructure. This comprehensive survey examines the 
            theoretical foundations, methodological approaches, and practical applications 
            of RL techniques in heterogeneous scheduling environments. We systematically 
            review over 200 research papers spanning the past decade, categorizing approaches 
            into foundational theories, algorithmic innovations, and real-world deployments. 
            Our analysis reveals key challenges including multi-objective optimization, 
            scalability constraints, and sim-to-real transfer gaps. We identify emerging 
            trends in multi-agent coordination, meta-learning for adaptation, and quantum-inspired 
            optimization. This survey provides researchers and practitioners with a structured 
            understanding of the field's current state and outlines promising directions 
            for future research, particularly in areas of theoretical convergence guarantees, 
            real-time adaptation mechanisms, and large-scale deployment strategies.

## Introduction

Modern computing systems increasingly rely on heterogeneous architectures that 
            combine diverse processing units including CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, and specialized 
            accelerators. Effective scheduling in such environments requires sophisticated 
            decision-making capabilities that can adapt to dynamic workloads, varying 
            resource constraints, and multiple optimization objectives. Traditional 
            heuristic-based scheduling algorithms often struggle with the complexity 
            and scale of contemporary heterogeneous systems, motivating the exploration 
            of machine learning approaches, particularly reinforcement learning.
            
            Reinforcement learning offers a principled framework for learning optimal 
            scheduling policies through interaction with the environment. Unlike 
            supervised learning approaches that require extensive labeled datasets, 
            RL agents can learn directly from system feedback, making them particularly 
            suitable for dynamic scheduling scenarios where optimal strategies may 
            evolve over time.
            
            This survey provides a comprehensive examination of RL applications in 
            heterogeneous scheduling, covering theoretical foundations, algorithmic 
            innovations, and practical implementations. We analyze the evolution 
            from simple single-agent approaches to sophisticated multi-agent systems 
            capable of coordinated decision-making across distributed environments.


### Motivation and Scope

The motivation for applying RL to heterogeneous scheduling stems from 
                    several key factors: (1) the increasing complexity of modern computing 
                    systems, (2) the dynamic nature of workloads and resource availability, 
                    (3) the need for multi-objective optimization considering performance, 
                    energy efficiency, and fairness, and (4) the limitations of traditional 
                    optimization approaches in handling uncertainty and adaptation.

## Background and Preliminaries

This section establishes the foundational concepts necessary for understanding 
            RL applications in heterogeneous scheduling. We provide formal definitions 
            of scheduling problems, RL frameworks, and their intersection.


### Heterogeneous Scheduling Fundamentals

Heterogeneous scheduling involves allocating tasks to diverse processing 
                    units with varying capabilities, constraints, and performance characteristics. 
                    Key challenges include resource heterogeneity, task dependencies, 
                    multi-objective optimization, and dynamic workload patterns.
                    
                    Formally, we define a heterogeneous scheduling problem as a tuple 
                    (T, R, C, O) where T represents the task set, R the resource set, 
                    C the constraint set, and O the optimization objectives.

### Reinforcement Learning Framework

Reinforcement learning provides a mathematical framework for 
                    sequential decision-making under uncertainty. The standard RL 
                    formulation uses Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) defined by 
                    the tuple (S, A, P, R, Î³) representing states, actions, 
                    transition probabilities, rewards, and discount factor.
                    
                    For scheduling applications, states typically encode system 
                    configuration and workload information, actions represent 
                    scheduling decisions, and rewards reflect optimization objectives.

## Theoretical Foundations

### Convergence Guarantees

The theoretical foundation of RL for heterogeneous scheduling rests on establishing 
convergence guarantees for multi-objective optimization in dynamic environments. 
Recent work has extended classical convergence results to accommodate the unique 
challenges of heterogeneous systems including non-stationary environments, 
multi-modal objective functions, and resource constraints.

Key theoretical contributions include:
- Extension of Robbins-Monro conditions for multi-objective RL
- Sample complexity bounds for heterogeneous action spaces
- Regret analysis for online scheduling algorithms
- Stability analysis for multi-agent coordination

### Sample Complexity Analysis

Sample complexity in heterogeneous scheduling presents unique challenges due to 
the large state-action spaces and the need for efficient exploration across 
diverse resource types. Recent theoretical advances provide bounds that scale 
logarithmically with the number of heterogeneous resources under specific 
structural assumptions.

### Multi-Objective Optimization Theory

The multi-objective nature of heterogeneous scheduling requires extending 
single-objective RL theory to Pareto-optimal solutions. This involves:
- Scalarization techniques and their convergence properties
- Pareto frontier approximation guarantees
- Trade-off analysis between conflicting objectives
