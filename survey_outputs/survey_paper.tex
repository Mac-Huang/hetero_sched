\section{Introduction}
Modern computing systems increasingly rely on heterogeneous architectures that combine diverse processing units including CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, and specialized accelerators.

\section{Background and Preliminaries}
This section establishes the foundational concepts necessary for understanding RL applications in heterogeneous scheduling.

\section{Theoretical Foundations}
The theoretical foundation of RL for heterogeneous scheduling rests on establishing convergence guarantees for multi-objective optimization in dynamic environments.

\section{Methodological Approaches}
Single-agent and multi-agent RL methods have been extensively developed for scheduling applications.

\section{Applications and Case Studies}
Real-world applications demonstrate the practical value of RL-based scheduling approaches.

\section{Current Challenges and Limitations}
Several challenges remain in scaling RL to production scheduling systems.

\section{Future Research Directions}
Emerging paradigms and methodological advances point toward exciting future opportunities.

\section{Conclusion}
This comprehensive survey reveals a rapidly maturing field with significant theoretical depth and practical impact.
