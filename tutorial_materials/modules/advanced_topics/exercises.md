## Submission Guidelines

1. Save your solutions in separate files named `exercise_1.py`, `exercise_2.py`, etc.
2. Include comments explaining your approach
3. Test your code with the provided test cases
4. Document any assumptions or design decisions

## Self-Assessment

After completing the exercises, ask yourself:
- [ ] Do I understand the core concepts?
- [ ] Can I explain my solution approach?
- [ ] Does my code handle edge cases correctly?
- [ ] Am I ready for the next module?
