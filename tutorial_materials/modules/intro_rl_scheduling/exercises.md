# Exercises for Introduction to RL and Scheduling

## Instructions

Complete the following exercises to reinforce your understanding of the concepts covered in this module. Work through them in order, as later exercises may build on earlier ones.

**Estimated Time:** 45 minutes

## Exercise Set


### Exercise 1: Identify RL components in a simple scheduling scenario

**Objective:** Practice identify rl components in a simple scheduling scenario

**Instructions:**
1. Review the relevant section in the tutorial
2. Implement the solution step by step  
3. Test your implementation with provided examples
4. Verify results against expected outputs

**Starter Code:**
```python
# TODO: Implement your solution here
def exercise_1_solution():
    '''Implement identify rl components in a simple scheduling scenario'''
    pass

# Test your solution
if __name__ == "__main__":
    result = exercise_1_solution()
    print(f"Result: {result}")
```

**Expected Output:**
[Describe what the correct output should look like]

**Hints:**
- Consider the key concepts from section X
- Remember to handle edge cases
- Use the provided utility functions if helpful

### Exercise 2: Compare heuristic vs. RL approaches

**Objective:** Practice compare heuristic vs. rl approaches

**Instructions:**
1. Review the relevant section in the tutorial
2. Implement the solution step by step  
3. Test your implementation with provided examples

    '''Implement design a basic reward function'''
    pass

# Test your solution
if __name__ == "__main__":
    result = exercise_3_solution()
    print(f"Result: {result}")
```

**Expected Output:**

## Submission Guidelines

1. Save your solutions in separate files named `exercise_1.py`, `exercise_2.py`, etc.
2. Include comments explaining your approach
3. Test your code with the provided test cases
4. Document any assumptions or design decisions

## Self-Assessment

After completing the exercises, ask yourself:
- [ ] Do I understand the core concepts?
- [ ] Can I explain my solution approach?
- [ ] Does my code handle edge cases correctly?
- [ ] Am I ready for the next module?
