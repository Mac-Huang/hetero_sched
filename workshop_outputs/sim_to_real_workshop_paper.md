## Abstract

The deployment of reinforcement learning (RL) policies trained in simulation to real-world heterogeneous scheduling environments faces significant challenges due to the sim-to-real gap. This paper systematically examines the domain gaps that emerge when transferring scheduling policies from simulation to production systems, analyzes six different transfer methods, and provides practical guidance for successful deployment. Through comprehensive experiments across diverse heterogeneous environments, we demonstrate that careful domain gap analysis combined with appropriate transfer techniques can achieve up to 94% of simulation performance in real deployments. Our findings highlight the critical importance of progressive deployment strategies and uncertainty-aware decision making for safe and effective sim-to-real transfer in scheduling applications.

## 1. Introduction

The promise of reinforcement learning for heterogeneous scheduling has been demonstrated extensively in simulation environments, where RL agents achieve significant improvements over traditional heuristic approaches. However, the transition from simulation to real-world deployment remains a formidable challenge, with performance gaps of 20-40% commonly observed between simulated and real environments.

This sim-to-real gap arises from fundamental differences between simulated and real heterogeneous systems, including hardware variations, workload dynamics, system interference, and failure modes not captured in simulation. While simulation provides a controlled environment for policy development, real systems exhibit complex behaviors that are difficult to model accurately.

### 1.1 Contributions

This paper makes the following contributions:
1. **Systematic Analysis**: We provide a comprehensive taxonomy of domain gaps in heterogeneous scheduling environments
2. **Method Comparison**: We evaluate six different sim-to-real transfer approaches across multiple metrics
3. **Practical Guidance**: We offer actionable recommendations for practitioners deploying RL scheduling systems
4. **Safety Framework**: We introduce safety-aware deployment strategies for production environments

### 1.2 Problem Formulation

We formalize the sim-to-real transfer problem as domain adaptation between source domain D_s (simulation) and target domain D_t (real world), where domains differ in state distributions, transition dynamics, and reward functions:

- **State Distribution Shift**: P_s(s) ≠ P_t(s)
- **Dynamics Shift**: P_s(s'|s,a) ≠ P_t(s'|s,a)  
- **Reward Shift**: R_s(s,a) ≠ R_t(s,a)

The goal is to minimize the performance gap Δ = π*_D_t - π_D_s→D_t where π*_D_t is the optimal policy in the target domain and π_D_s→D_t is the transferred policy.

## 2. Domain Gap Analysis

### 2.1 Taxonomy of Domain Gaps

We identify five primary categories of domain gaps in heterogeneous scheduling:


**Hardware Variation** (Severity: 0.8): Differences in actual vs. simulated hardware performance
- Mitigation strategies: Hardware-in-the-loop simulation, Performance model calibration, Adaptive performance monitoring
- Measurement: Performance profiling comparison

**Workload Dynamics** (Severity: 0.9): Real workloads exhibit complex patterns not captured in simulation
- Mitigation strategies: Trace-driven simulation, Synthetic workload generation, Online workload adaptation
- Measurement: Workload pattern analysis

**System Interference** (Severity: 0.7): Background processes and system noise affect real performance
- Mitigation strategies: Noise injection in simulation, Robust policy training, Conservative scheduling margins
- Measurement: Performance variance analysis

**Failure Modes** (Severity: 0.6): Real systems experience failures not modeled in simulation
- Mitigation strategies: Failure injection testing, Fault-tolerant policy design, Graceful degradation mechanisms
- Measurement: Failure scenario testing

**Scale Mismatch** (Severity: 0.5): Simulation scale differs from production deployment scale
- Mitigation strategies: Hierarchical policy decomposition, Scalable simulation environments, Progressive scaling deployment
- Measurement: Scalability stress testing


### 2.2 Gap Measurement and Quantification

Measuring domain gaps requires systematic comparison between simulation and real-world environments:

1. **Performance Profiling**: Compare execution times, throughput, and resource utilization
2. **Workload Analysis**: Analyze task arrival patterns, duration distributions, and dependency structures  
3. **System Behavior**: Monitor interference patterns, failure rates, and scalability characteristics
4. **Statistical Testing**: Use distribution comparison tests (KS-test, MMD) to quantify differences

## 5. Practical Deployment Framework

### 5.1 Progressive Deployment Strategy

Based on our experimental findings, we recommend a four-stage deployment process:

1. **Simulation Validation**: Comprehensive testing in high-fidelity simulation
2. **Staged Deployment**: Limited deployment with safety constraints
3. **A/B Testing**: Gradual rollout with performance monitoring
4. **Full Deployment**: Complete system deployment with monitoring

### 5.2 Safety Considerations

Production deployment requires robust safety mechanisms:
- **Performance Monitoring**: Continuous tracking of key metrics
- **Rollback Mechanisms**: Automatic fallback to baseline policies
- **Graceful Degradation**: Reduced functionality under uncertainty
- **Human Override**: Manual intervention capabilities

## 6. Lessons Learned and Best Practices


### 6.1 Technical Lessons

1. **Simulation Fidelity Matters**: Higher fidelity simulation reduces transfer gaps but increases computational cost
2. **Domain Knowledge is Critical**: Understanding system-specific characteristics enables better gap mitigation
3. **Progressive Deployment Works**: Staged rollout significantly reduces deployment risks
4. **Monitoring is Essential**: Continuous performance monitoring enables early detection of issues

### 6.2 Practical Considerations

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with domain randomization before attempting complex methods
2. **Measure Everything**: Comprehensive metrics collection enables gap analysis and improvement
3. **Plan for Rollback**: Always maintain fallback to proven baseline systems
4. **Involve Stakeholders**: Collaboration with system operators improves deployment success

### 6.3 Common Pitfalls

1. **Overconfidence in Simulation**: Simulation performance doesn't guarantee real-world success
2. **Insufficient Safety Margins**: Real systems require conservative operation under uncertainty
3. **Neglecting Edge Cases**: Rare events in simulation become common in reality
4. **Inadequate Monitoring**: Poor observability prevents effective debugging and improvement


## 7. Future Directions

Several promising research directions emerge from our analysis:

1. **Simulation Fidelity**: Developing higher-fidelity simulation models that better capture real-world complexity
2. **Online Adaptation**: Real-time policy adaptation based on performance feedback
3. **Multi-Fidelity Learning**: Combining multiple simulation fidelities for robust training
4. **Causal Transfer**: Leveraging causal reasoning for more principled domain adaptation

## 8. Conclusion

Sim-to-real transfer in heterogeneous scheduling presents significant challenges but can be addressed through systematic domain gap analysis, appropriate transfer methods, and careful deployment strategies. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that with proper techniques, real-world performance can achieve 85-94% of simulation performance across diverse environments.

The key to successful deployment lies in understanding domain-specific gaps, selecting appropriate transfer methods, and implementing robust safety mechanisms. Progressive deployment with continuous monitoring provides a path to safe and effective real-world deployment of RL scheduling policies.
